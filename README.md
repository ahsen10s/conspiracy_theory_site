<h3>Why I made my project about conspiracy theories?</h3>
The internet has revolutionized the way that people communicate and access information. It has become a vast repository of knowledge, with vast amounts of information available at the click of a button. However, this vast amount of information also has its drawbacks. One of the major drawbacks of the internet is its ability to facilitate the spread of conspiracy theories.
Conspiracy theories are unfounded beliefs that often involve some sort of secretive group or organization that is working against the best interests of society. These theories are often based on little or no evidence and are often far-fetched and unlikely. Despite this, they can still be incredibly persuasive and can gain a significant following, especially on the internet.
One of the reasons why the internet facilitates the spread of conspiracy theories is because it allows people to connect and share information with others who share their beliefs. This creates echo chambers where people only hear information that confirms their existing beliefs and are not exposed to alternative perspectives. This can make it very difficult for people to critically evaluate the information that they are exposed to, and can make them more susceptible to believing in conspiracy theories.
Another reason why the internet facilitates the spread of conspiracy theories is because it allows for the easy dissemination of false information. The internet is a vast and complex network, and it can be difficult to determine the veracity of information that is posted online. This means that false information can easily be spread, and it can be difficult for people to determine whether or not it is true. This can lead to the spread of conspiracy theories that are based on false information.
The internet also makes it easy for conspiracy theories to gain traction because it allows for the creation of fake news. Fake news is a term that is used to describe information that is deliberately created to be misleading or false. This can take the form of articles, videos, or even entire websites that are designed to spread false information. These fake news sources can be incredibly persuasive, and they can be easily shared on social media and other online platforms, allowing them to reach a wide audience.
In addition to this, the internet also allows for the creation of online communities where people can share and discuss their beliefs. These communities can be very insular and can create a sense of belonging and solidarity among their members. This can make it difficult for people to challenge the beliefs of others, and can make it easier for conspiracy theories to gain a foothold and spread.
In conclusion, the internet has greatly facilitated the spread of conspiracy theories. Its ability to connect people, disseminate information, and create echo chambers and online communities has made it easier for these theories to gain traction and gain a following. While the internet has many positive aspects, this is one of the potential drawbacks that should be considered. It is important for people to be critical of the information that they encounter online, and to evaluate it carefully before accepting it as true. This can help to prevent the spread of false information and conspiracy theories.


<h3>Execution of Project</h3>
For my project I wanted to show how a seemingly innocent google search (muffin recipes) could potentially lead to dangerous conspiracy theories. After clicking the “Google Search” button viewers are taken the main sight. Just like a entering a “rabbit hole” the viewers have to keep scrolling down on the website to see where it leads.
I wanted the site to look heavy, so I went for a dark color theme. I also chose not to display too much text in the site and instead have many images in order to provide a more visual experience for viewers.
This was the first time I incorporated parallax scrolling into a website, and I am glad it turned out well. It only required some new css attributes. I also wanted to add AOS (Animation on Scroll) but the code for some reason was not working. My panels would just disappear whenever I had AOS running along side it.
